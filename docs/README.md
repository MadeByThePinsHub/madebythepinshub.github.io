# Coding Hub by the Pins

Welcome to the Pins team's Coding Hub! This is where we showcase our projects related to how and what we code.

## Navigating Around the site

Because we use `docsify`, an painless and small (241kb) package for Node.js, you can navigate using the **built-in search engine** and __Hamburger menu__.

You can also use this navigation section to navigate around the website.
